### A free funding suitability checking tool

![Screenshot of the website beehivegiving.org](/assets/posts/beehive-screenshot.png)

I founded, designed and developed [Beehive](https://github.com/TechforgoodCAST/beehive-giving){:target="\_blank"}. It was a free funding suitability checking tool that used a funderâ€™s guidelines, priorities and open data to produce a report that helped over 18,000+ fund seekers decide where to apply.
