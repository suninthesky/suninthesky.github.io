# Design is a verb

Design is not a department, it's a discipline.

It's a muscle that needs to be grown and maintained.

It's something that is infused throughout an organisation or endeavour, not parachuted in.

It's a verb, something you do, rather than a job title.

It's understanding that many decisions you make are design decisions.

Design is not making something look pretty - that's content creation, graphic work or art - true design is about bringing people together around a shared approach and principles to improve a situation.
