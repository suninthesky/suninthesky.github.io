# When we can change course easily our need for long range predictions gets less

Think of it like a speed boat and a large cargo ship.

If an obstacle presents itself the speed boat can respond with agility and speed.

Whereas a large cargo ship needs lots of forewarning if it stands a chance of navigating the situation unscathed.

This analogy can be applied to work and life. In situations with lots of uncertainty or change being like a speed boat is preferred.
